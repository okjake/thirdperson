Third Person
============

Third Person is the basis for an interactive installation. 

## Input
One or more camera or video feeds.  
Works best when environmental light changes are mitigated - IR illuminators & filters work well.  

## Processing
Participants are identified in the space by diffing frames against a background scene which is learned over time.  
The activity and balance of people in space is used to mix and filter sound, and several metrics about the current scene are sent over OSC to be used externally.  
Optical flow - to be documented

## Output
Live mix of two or more audio stems.  
OSC - to be documented
